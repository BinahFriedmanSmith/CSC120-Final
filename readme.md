two things i have learned while watching people play my game:

1. I have played too many text adventure games to understand what is obvious
2. Some people just do not get it no matter what.

Anyway:


    What was your overall approach to tackling this project?
Step 1: panic
Step 2: ???
Step 3: profit
    What new thing(s) did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
I learned a lot about HashMaps! I was also pretty worried about making a parser, but I figured out one strategy without too much trouble
    Is there anything that you wish you had implemented differently?
Definitely the PUT CAGE ON [item] command. super sloppy and last minute, i would rather have the handling more spread out over relevant classes like the other commands, and be more general rather than only working with the cage 
    If you had unlimited time, what additional features would you implement?
I'd love to make a huge puzzle game with more complicated puzzles. I especially would like more body swapping, with different kinds of creatures that have different abilities (like a lion, or a giant who can rearrange large sections of the map)
    What was the most helpful piece of feedback you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
Just talking my project through with both of you (Ab and Jordan) (idk which of you guys reads these but i cried at both of you seperately) while i was feeling really overwhelmed was really helpful. I'm not sure if there was any one piece of advice that stood out
    If you could go back in time and give your past self some advice about this project, what hints would you give?
USB stick containing the "finished" game


ok maybe something like "don't worry yet about what you don't know how to do, just start with what you know you can do"
